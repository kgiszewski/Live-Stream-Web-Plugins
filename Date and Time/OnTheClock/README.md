# Countdown Timer
A simple plugin powered by Moment.js and Coundown.js.

Highly customizable, set the date in the future or just add a few seconds from now.

Output formatting is a matter of options passed into the args.

Currently setup to stop at zero, though you can rework it to count back up after the time has passed.
